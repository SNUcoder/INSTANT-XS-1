# INSTANT-XS

This is an app "inspired" by ***Linux Terminal***, which is made for slow PCs that can't even open File Explorer and people who don't have time
This thing opens apps instantly, for now this may suck but in future we will upgrade it and remove bugs (if any)

If you find a bug, please let us know, and we will certainly fix it.

Enjoy the app!
